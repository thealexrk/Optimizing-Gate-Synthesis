NB: This project is inspired by a tutorial by the following papers, the authors of which I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the code, data, and software I used:

> Juan Miguel Arrazola, Thomas R. Bromley, Josh Izaac, Casey R. Myers, Kamil Brádler, and Nathan Killoran. Machine learning method for state preparation and gate synthesis on photonic quantum computers. Quantum Science and Technology, 4 024004 (2019).

> Nathan Killoran, Josh Izaac, Nicolás Quesada, Ville Bergholm, Matthew Amy, and Christian Weedbrook. Strawberry Fields: A Software Platform for Photonic Quantum Computing. arXiv, 2018. Quantum, 3, 129 (2019).

This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Quantum Computing.
